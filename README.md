Welcome to my exam tool. This is a web based application which can administer a test that is created in a database. 
In order to run this project, you must run the create table scripts that are provided in mySQL or any database tool. Then you must modify the 
connection string in the DBQueries class in order to match your local database. You can then enter your test questions,choices and correct answers in 
the masterbank table. Make sure that for multiple choice questions, the choices are in JSON format. Sorry for the inconvienece, test builder for the tool is a work in progress.
